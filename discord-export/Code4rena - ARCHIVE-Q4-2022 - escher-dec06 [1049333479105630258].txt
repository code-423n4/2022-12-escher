Hey, is there a place where we can get a brief understanding of the project before the contest starts? I can't seem to find anything online.

gm sir! Escher aims to be the premiere market for editioned artwork and to make distributing work easier for artists and also more accessible for collectors


[12/06/2022 20:23] pfapostol
is it typo in description of "OpenEdition.sol" in "Overview" section?


[12/06/2022 20:30] snevins
Ahh good catch, the open editions don't have a capped supply


[12/06/2022 21:58] aviggiano

It seems like the README lacks some basic high-level explanation of the project.
What's the difference between Open Edition and Fixed Price sales?


[12/06/2022 22:58] snevins
Open edition has an uncapped supply and fixed price has capped supply

Please provide a brief explanation about the intention of minting/burning NFT while granting/revoking role in the `Escher.sol`


[12/07/2022 22:30] snevins
we thought it would be fun to have an NFT reflecting your role in Escher


[12/07/2022 22:31] jm217
I see. But it's not used in the other contracts at the moment, right? I can't find it being used as a proof of role anywhere


[12/07/2022 22:38] swaHili#3962
that's because the role itself is used as proof. the NFT is just a soul bound visual that represents the role

Hey can someone pls explain to me what the purpose of Generative.sol is and how it is used?


[12/08/2022 14:46] snevins
Basically that pattern was inspired by the QQL drop which can be found here https://etherscan.io/address/0x845dd2a7ee2a92a0518ab2135365ed63fdba0c88#readContract


[12/08/2022 14:53] aphak5010
It seems that currently your contracts do not make use of this feature. So the seeds can only be used by contracts that are not within the scope of this audit. Is this correct?

What is automation tool did you use for find these issues?


[12/08/2022 17:29] sovaslava9
why you didnt publish gas automation issues, when contes has started?


[12/08/2022 17:41] pfapostol
Is the full “life cycle” limited by: create, sell/buy NFT's? 
I see functions that are not used in contracts. Is  the audit part of a larger project, or is it a complete functionality?


[12/08/2022 17:51] cloudellie
Can we move this question back to the #❓questions channel, please? This is standard procedure for all Code4rena contests. Happy to discuss further, but let's keep discussion here specific to the Escher contest. Thanks.

For the most part complete, there might be more out of scope additions around the account that has DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE


[12/08/2022 18:07] snevins
And then we plan to role out additional metadata delegates and minting patterns

yeah it is possible.  if so many auditors find one bug


[01/12/2023 18:57] gz627
But it's quite unlikely. Anyway, where we can find out how many wardens find the same issue?
